## Ethical Considerations

I acknowledge the significant effort that learners invest in understanding new concepts, building intuition, and troubleshooting assignments. The solutions provided in this repository are **strictly for reference purposes**. They are intended to assist you in overcoming obstacles should you encounter any difficulties. I strongly discourage the verbatim copying of any part of the code (the programming assignments are quite manageable if the instructions are followed meticulously). Likewise, I encourage you to attempt the quizzes independently before seeing the provided solutions. This course, with its exceptional content and structure, is a valuable resource created by the deeplearning.ai team.
