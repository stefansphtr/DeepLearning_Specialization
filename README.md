# Deep Learning Specialization: Coursera (Presented by deeplearning.ai)

This repository contains programming assignments from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera, provided by `deeplearning.ai`.

Course Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Supplementary Resources

### For comprehensive, interview-ready notes on all courses within the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization, please visit [www.aman.ai](https://aman.ai/).

## Ethical Considerations

I acknowledge the significant effort that learners invest in understanding new concepts, building intuition, and troubleshooting assignments. The solutions provided in this repository are **strictly for reference purposes**. They are intended to assist you in overcoming obstacles should you encounter any difficulties. I strongly discourage the verbatim copying of any part of the code (the programming assignments are quite manageable if the instructions are followed meticulously). Likewise, I encourage you to attempt the quizzes independently before seeing the provided solutions. This course, with its exceptional content and structure, is a valuable resource created by the deeplearning.ai team.
